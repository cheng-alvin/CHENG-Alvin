I'm Alvin, a first-year middle school student from Melbourne, Australia. Right now, I'm passionately working on [Jas](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas), the assembler. In addition, I've also created numerous fun micro-projects of my own and even ran a coding club at my former school to help others. Passionate about low-level programming, assemblers, linkers, loaders and executables.

### My open source story 📖
I first started to learn how to program in early 2021 when the covid lockdowns were happening. With so much time in my hands I aquired a rich set of tools and technologies. In August, I decided to create an account on this website named Github and contributed to many open source projects, of course, as a young developer, the admins looked at me in denial and reject PR after PR. Meanwhile I've also cooked up acouple more projects of my own, such as [Chill&chat](https://github.com/chillandchat) or [Roo-OS](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/Roo-OS) to further enhance my skills in Javascript and C. In late 2022, I also became a member of the [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) team helping to maintain the ensure the upkeep of the frameork's internals. 

This brings us to 2023 where I've started to explore new technologies dived into other projects such as the [Jas assembler](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas). It's truly been a long and fun journey exploring the ins and outs of open source and just computer science in general, and I hope my story can inspire others to do the same.
