## 👋 G'day, welcome!
I'm Alvin, a first-year middle school student from Melbourne, Australia. Right now, I'm passionately learning about low-level programing. In addition, I've also created numerous fun micro-projects of my own and even ran a coding club at my former school to help others.

### Fun facts about me...
- 📝 My editor of choice is **Visual studio code** from Microsoft!
- 💭 My dream job is being a **Kernel engineer at Apple**!
- 🍎 Loyal **Apple fanboy**
- 🌏 I speak **two languages**!
- 🐧 **Linux Lover** (I use Arch BTW!)
