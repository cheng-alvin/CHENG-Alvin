## 👋 G'day, welcome!
I'm Alvin, a first-year middle school student from Melbourne, Australia. Right now, I'm passionately working on [Jas](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas), the assembler. In addition, I've also created numerous fun micro-projects of my own and even ran a coding club at my former school to help others. Passionate about low-level programming, assemblers, linkers, loaders and executables.
