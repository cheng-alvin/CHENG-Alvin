I'm Alvin, a second-year middle school student from Melbourne, Australia. Right now, I'm passionately working on [Jas](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas), the assembler. In addition, I've also created numerous fun micro-projects of my own and even ran a coding club at my former school to help others. Passionate about low-level programming, assemblers, linkers, loaders and executables.

### Fun facts about me...
- 📝 Loves **Visual studio code** from Microsoft!
- 💭 Dreams of being a **Kernel engineer at Apple**!                
- 🍎 Loyal **Apple fanboy**.
- 🌏 Speaks **two languages**!
- 🐧 **Linux Lover**. (I use Arch BTW!)
- ✈️ Travelled to **3 countries**!
  
### My open source story 📖
I first started to learn how to program in early 2021 when the covid lockdowns were happening. With so much time in my hands I aquired a rich set of tools and technologies. In August, I decided to create an account on this website named Github and contributed to many open source projects, of course, as a young developer, the PR reviewers looked at me in denial and reject PR after PR. Meanwhile I've also cooked up acouple more projects of my own, such as [Chill&chat](https://github.com/chillandchat) or [Roo-OS](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/Roo-OS) to further enhance my skills in Javascript and C. In late 2022, I also became a member of the [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) team helping to maintain the ensure the upkeep of the framework's internals. In 2023, I've started to work on the [Jas assembler](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas) project to expand my knowledge on low-level software engineering as well as programming in C (also causing many segmentation faults.) and the x86 assembler language.

### Future plans 🔮
In the future, I look forward to continue my assembler project and hoping to complete and publish it as a fully blown assembler that's actually competable with projects like nasm or yasm. My open source is a simple small hobby thing I do as a student, I also hope to extend progamming not just as a hobby but to an actual profession at Apple as a micro kernel engineer working on MacOS.
