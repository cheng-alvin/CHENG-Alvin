In addition, I've also created numerous fun micro-projects of my own and even ran a coding club at my former school to help others. Passionate about everything software, aviation, trains and trams.

### My open-source story 📖
I first started to learn how to program in early 2021 when the COVID lockdowns were happening. With so much time on my hands, I acquired a rich set of tools and technologies. In August, I decided to create an account on this website named GitHub and contributed to many open-source projects, of course, as a young developer, the PR reviewers looked at me in denial and rejected PR after PR. Meanwhile, I've also cooked up a couple more projects of my own, such as [Chill&chat](https://github.com/chillandchat) or [Roo-OS](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/Roo-OS) to further enhance my skills in Javascript and C. In late 2022, I also became a member of the [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) team helping to ensure the upkeep of the framework's internals. In 2023, I started to work on the [Jas assembler](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas) project to expand my knowledge on low-level software engineering as well as programming in C (also causing many segmentation faults.) and the x86 assembler language.
