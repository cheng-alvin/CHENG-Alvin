### About me
Hey there! Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening!
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Alvin, a first-year middle school student from Melbourne, Australia. I started coding on GitHub on August 1, 2021! Right now, I'm passionately working on [Durian.js](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/durian.js) which is a Javascript framework that I am working on! In addition, I've also created numerous fun micro-projects of my own and even ran a coding club at my former school to help others. I hope you're having a fantastic day, and I would be thrilled if you decide to follow me! Don't forget to check out and download my apps too, they're definitely worth trying! 😀
