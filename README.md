## 👋 G'day, welcome!
I'm Alvin, a first-year middle school student from Melbourne, Australia. Right now, I'm passionately working on [Durian.js](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/durian.js) which is a Javascript framework that simplifies web development! In addition, I've also created numerous fun micro-projects of my own and even ran a coding club at my former school to help others.

### Fun facts about me...
